    <h1>Delay</h1>
    <p>
      Our last transition property is <code>transition-delay</code>. Much like
      duration, its value is an amount of time. Delay specifies the time to wait
      before starting the transition. As with the duration property, the default
      value for <code>transition-delay</code> is 0s, which means no delay.
    </p>
    <pre>
    <code>
      transition-property: width;
      transition-duration: 750ms;
      transition-delay: 250ms;
    </code>
  </pre>
    <p>
      In the example above, a change in the width of the element will start
      after a quarter of a second, and it will animate over three quarters of a
      second.
    </p>

            Right now the gazelle immediately begins the transition to the new
            state when the mouse hovers over it. Let's add a delay to make the
            game a little more interesting.
          </p>
          <p>In the .game .gazelle ruleset, add a delay of 400ms.</p>
