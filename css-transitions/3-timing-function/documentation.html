  <h1>
    Timing Function
  </h1>
  <p>
    The next transition property is transition-timing-function. The timing function describes the pace of the transition.
  </p>
  <p>
    The default value is ease, which starts the transition slowly, speeds up in the middle, and slows down again at the end.
  </p>
  <p>
    Other valid values include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      ease-in — starts slow, accelerates quickly, stops abruptly
    </li>
      ease-out — begins abruptly, slows down, and ends slowly
    </li>
    <li>
      ease-in-out — starts slow, gets fast in the middle, and ends slowly
    </li>
    <li>
      linear — constant speed throughout
    </li>
  </ul>
  <pre>
    <code>
      transition-property: color;
      transition-duration: 1s;
      transition-timing-function: ease-out;
    </code>
  </pre>
  <p>
    In the example above, the text color will be animated over one second. The timing function is ease-out which means it will begin abruptly and slow down as it ends.
  </p>

  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <div>
        <p>Let's use the <code>transition-timing-function</code> property in a game! Find the gazelle in the picture to your right and move your mouse over it. Hint: It's under a zebra's head.</p>
        <p>Add transition-timing-function as a property to the <code> .game .gazelle </code> ruleset with the value linear.</p>
        <p>Hover your mouse over the gazelle to observe the difference in motion. If you can't tell the difference, you can change the <code>transition-duration</code> value to be longer.</p>
