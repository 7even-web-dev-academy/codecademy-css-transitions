    <h1>Shorthand</h1>
    <p>
      Now that we've explored each transition property, you may find yourself
      with many CSS rule sets that look like the code below.
    </p>
    <pre>
     <code>
        transition-property: color;
        transition-duration: 1.5s;
        transition-timing-function: linear;
        transition-delay: 0.5s;
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      Because these four properties are so frequently declared together, CSS
      provides a property that can be used to declare them all in one line:
      transition. This shorthand property describes each aspect of the
      transition puzzle in a single declaration. The properties must be
      specified in this order: transition-property, transition-duration,
      transition-timing-function, transition-delay.
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        transition: color 1.5s linear 0.5s;
       </code>
     </pre>
    <p>
      In the example above, we have refactored the four lines of code in the
      previous example into one concise line. This example will cause any change
      in text color to transition at constant speed over 1.5 seconds, after a
      delay of 0.5 seconds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving out one of the properties causes the default value for that
      property to be applied. There is one exception: You must set duration if
      you want to define delay. Since both are time values, the browser will
      always interpret the first time value it sees as duration.
    </p>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine all the transition properties for the gazelle into one,
        shorthand declaration. The property being transitioned is max-height,
        with a duration of 750ms. The timing function is linear, and the delay
        is 400ms.
      </li>
    </ol>
