    <p>
      CSS Transitions are a powerful tool for providing visual feedback to
      users. We've learned a lot about transitions, so let's review:
    </p>
    <p>CSS Transitions have 4 components:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A property that will transition.</li>
      <li>The duration which describes how long the transition takes.</li>
      <li>The delay to pause before the transition will take place.</li>
      <li>The timing function that describes the transition's acceleration.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      A simple transition can be described with a property and a duration, which
      can be written like this:
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        transition-property: color;
        transition-duration: 1s;
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      Many properties' state changes can be transitioned, including color,
      background color, font size, width, and height. all is also a valid
      transition property that causes every changing property to transition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shorthand property transition can be used to describe all four
      components of a transition at once. By using the comma (,) operator, many
      transitions can be described in one CSS rule.
    </p>

      If you want to learn more about CSS Transitions, we recommend MDN's Using
      CSS Transitions doc.
